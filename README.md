# HR ANALYTICS DASHBOARD
HR Analytics Dashboard built using a real-world employee dataset.
 It highlights key insights such as employee count, attrition rate, department-wise attrition, age-group distribution, job satisfaction, and gender-based attrition trends.
This project helped me strengthen my skills in Tableau, KPIs, and data visualization.

This project strengthened my skills in:

 Tableau Desktop
 Calculated fields & KPI creation
 Dashboard design 
 HR data exploration
 Insight generation for strategic decisions
